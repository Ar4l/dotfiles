# Hammerspoon

[Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) is a tool for powerful automation.
Sadly, I just use it as my window manager.

I use the [miro window
manager](https://github.com/miromannino/miro-windows-manager) package to do
this.

## Keybindings

`alt + control` as hyper key
`h/j/k/l` as direction keys
`f` as fullsceen key
