# Dotfiles #

A set of files that begin with a dot and are updated quite frequently.

~I use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) behind the scenes to symlink the~
~files into my home directory.~

I am writing my own dotfiles manager in [fish](https://fishshell.com) at the
moment, stay tuned!

## Dependencies ##

* A relatively new Vim version (ideally 7.5 and above) compiled with Python3
  support. For more info, check this [Github
  issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/20327)
* A relatively new Zsh version as your shell.
* A relatively new Tmux version (ideally 2.1 and above).
* iTerm as your terminal since the default terminal app does not play nice with
  italics.
* [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/) as your Vim plugin manager.
* [Zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) as your Zsh plugin manager.
* ~[rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage your dotfiles.~
* [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) to manage your rubies.
* [reattach-to-user-namespace](https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard)
  if using Tmux version below 2.6 (Tmux bakes this in starting at version 2.6).
* [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) for
  notifications from processes.
