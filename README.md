# Dotfiles #

A set of files that begin with a dot and are updated quite frequently.

I use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) behind the scenes to symlink the
files into my home directory. Instructions on getting started with rcm can be
found at [Thoughtbot's dotfiles repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).
