# Dotfiles #

A set of files that begin with a dot and are updated quite frequently.

I use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) behind the scenes to symlink the
files into my home directory. Instructions on getting started with rcm can be
found at [Thoughtbot's dotfiles repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

## Dependencies ##

* A relatively new Vim version (ideally 7.5 and above).
* A relatively new Zsh version as your shell.
* A relatively new Tmux version (ideally 2.1 and above).
* iTerm as your terminal since the default terminal app does not play nice with
  italics.
* [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/) as your Vim plugin manager.
* [Zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) as your Zsh plugin manager.
* [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage your dotfiles.
* [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) to manage your rubies.
