# Karabiner

[karabiner elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) is a utility
to customize the keyboard on a osx system.

I have the following keybindings in place, motivated primarily by symmetry:

1. `capslock` to `esc` on single press, `left control` when held
2. `return` to `return` on single press, `right control` when held
3. space cadet shifts (round brackets on single press, normal behaviour when held)
